# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

a. Scan infrastructure as code templates
Checkov is a static code analysis tool for infrastructure-as-code. It scans cloud infrastructure provisioned using Terraform, Cloudformation or Kubernetes and detects security and compliance misconfigurations.

Example vulnerability
- "Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0:0 to port 3389"
- "Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0:0 to port 22"
- "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket is securely encrypted at rest"
- "Ensure CloudTrail logs are encrypted at rest using KMS CMKs"

b. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
Anchore Engine allow detailed analysis on container images. Anchore Engine can prevent publication of images containing known vulnerabilities

Example vulnerability
Vulnerability ID  Package         Severity  Fix        Vulnerability URL
CVE-2019-14697    musl-1.1.22.r2  High      1.1.22-r3  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14697

c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
AWS Config is an auditing tool that provides an inventory of existing resources, allowing an administrator to accurately track AWS assets to analyse compliance levels and security

Example vulnerability
s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled - Checks that your Amazon S3 bucket either has S3 default encryption enabled or that the S3 bucket policy explicitly denies put-object requests without server side encryption.
