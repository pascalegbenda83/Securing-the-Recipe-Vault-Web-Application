# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

- Add CloudFront in front of the load balancer and ensure to use the AWS Systems Manager if you need to access EC2 instances. Also disable external access to the EC2 instances.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

- A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network. Using VPC private endpoints alone would not prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket if the IAM permissions are still insecure.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, applying default encryption will not encrypt the existing files. You would need to encrypt all the files as well.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

The remediation steps that have been taken will be revert and all of the original security risks would be back. Therefore, the CloudFormation scripts should be updated with the required changes.
