# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

- Disable the password login on the application server
- Restrict the network traffic that can reach the application server

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the event that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

To prevent this from happening, one should:

- Use least privilege access for the existing instance role profile to only allow access to specific buckets rather than using a wildcard(*). A bucket policy can also be implemented.
- For more protection of the s3 bucket contents:
  > Server-side encryption on the S3 bucket must be enabled
  > Restrict the instance profile role to only read from S3 until the applicationis required to write.
